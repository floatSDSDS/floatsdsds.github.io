# floatsd personal blog

Welcome guys to my personal blog, sorry for having most posts in English (yet);D. Since resources in some specific area in Chinese are not incomplete in English. I can't imagine a better time than my records out of interest make any trivial help to someone(and forgetful me in the future).

**News** Looking for RA/PhD Positions in Graph Mining and its applications, either in Social or Transportation Networks. If you feel interested and want to know more about me, please check on my [CV](https://github.com/floatSDSDS/floatsdsds.github.io/raw/master/_data/LuFANRA-PHD1801.pdf).
