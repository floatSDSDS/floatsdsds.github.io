Welcome guys.

To give the vistors behind a 5-inch screen a little convenience, let's start with [posts sorted by time](https://floatsdsds.github.io/posts) and [posts sorted by tags](https://floatsdsds.github.io/tags).

I hate pirated software, instead, I seek for light weight free tools. If you are looking for an alternative, feel free to info me anytime.

I'm doing some translate work about R, from English to Chinese, as I was searching in the pages. I would be gald if someone would point out my errors or even join in the translation.

**I am responsible for everything I wrote and I love everything I create.**
