Welcome guys! This is floatsd, a girl design to become a punster in data science field.

In order to give vistors come with mobile a little convenience, let's start with [posts sorted by time](https://floatsdsds.github.io/tags) and [posts sorted by tags](https://floatsdsds.github.io/tags).

I noticed Chinese R community is still young and lack of tutorials or materials. Especially, I'm that kind of person can never appreciate tech blog without any code block highlight or sample plot, the graphic explanation. In this blog I would record all those bugs I met, all those tricks I found and all those experiences within novel packages, I'll try my best to make it easy to get.

Beside R, I'm a light weight free tool seeker and dislike using pirated software, so if you need help on looking for a alternative for some software, feel free to email me anytime.

This word cloud may be called 'what is me-Ver'. floatsd, if you want to know more about me please check my [English](https://floatsdsds.github.io/floatsd-CV-EN/) or [Chinese](https://floatsdsds.github.io/floatsd-CV-EN/) CV.
