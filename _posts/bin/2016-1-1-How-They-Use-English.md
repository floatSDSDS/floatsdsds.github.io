## Sentences
- New language constructs usually propagate along an S-shape curve.
- We show that the system **undergoes a disorder/order transition**, going through a sharp symmetry breaking process to reach a shared set of conventions.
- the degree to which/ an agent’s vocabulary/ is similar to that of others/ is considered to determine its reproductive fitness.
- natural selection drives the population towards convergence.
- There can be a flux in the population.
- Each player is characterized by his **inventory**
- It is evident that single runs originate quite irregular curves.
- The asymptotic state is one where a word invented during the time evolution took over with respect to the other competing words and imposed itself as the leading word.
- The proof is straightforward.
- In order to better see this phenomenon and then understand shy it is the case.
- Both curves exhibit a power law behaviour with an exponent 3/2.
- each agent is characterized by its inventory
- language arises and develops presumably
- This question engages fields as diverse as linguistics, sociology, and cognitive science.
- How do shared conventions emerge in complex decentralized social systems?
- There is widespread interest in xx.
- Several difficulties have limited prior empirical research in this area.
- but further analysis along this line is left for the future
- and their cumulative pay was updated accordingly
- local groups of coordinated individuals emerged and competed for dominance
- The ecology evolved quite differently in xx situation
- After the initial transient a dominant convention rapidly emerged, breaking the symmetry with its competitors and shifting the population into a "winner take all" regime.
- the dynamics converged on a global conventions
- consistent results were found for each of the topologies
- Language is a very complex human behaviour, which results from interactions among a population of individuals, who in turn interact with their environment
- Language continuously changes over time by adapting to the environment and the individuals
- these weights are adaptive
- In particular, the weights of connections between agents differentiate the probabilities of their mutual communication.
- the above rules greatly reduce computational complexity, but are to some extent artificial
- the model quickly reaches the regime
- one can thus distinguish three phases
- some very basic characteristics of human languages could be reproduced within our model.
- In this case our model does not reach complete synchronization but remains trapped in a multi-language state.
- Adaptively rewiring the links can happen in the real world. usually pepole are more likely to maintain a social connection with similar views, which is also known as homophily.
- We found that network evolution is dominated by a combination of effects arising from network topology itself and the organizational structure in which the network is embedded
- The structure of the network and the distribution of
opinions over the population evolve towards a state where the population is divided into disconnected communities whose agents share the same opinion
-  In spite of the simplicity of the evolution rules, the population can reach a variety of social patterns, which range from splitting into two communities of similar sizes and opposite opinions, to a single large community with homogeneous opinion.
- any pair of agents can potentially interact
- the network is split into disconnected subsets
- As  a  result,  all  the  re-alizations  are  represented  by  dots  in  a  rather  compact  cloud
- a clear boundary between the three classes cannot beunambiguously drawn
