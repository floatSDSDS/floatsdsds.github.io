## OVERVIEW

I have prepared [a formal resume](https://github.com/floatSDSDS/floatsdsds.github.io/raw/master/_data/Lu%20Fan%20DM.pdf) in pdf. In this page nothing would be repeated, the post is more like an addition, with photos, plots and details. Actually, I first conceived this self-explantory page summarizing my four year campus to explain on my poor overall GPA.
