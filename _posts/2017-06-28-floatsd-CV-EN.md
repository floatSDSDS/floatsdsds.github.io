## OVERVIEW

I have prepared [a formal resume](https://github.com/floatSDSDS/floatsdsds.github.io/raw/master/_data/Lu%20Fan%20DM.pdf) in pdf. In this post nothing would be repeated, the page is more like an addition with pics and details. [Donload Resume](https://github.com/floatSDSDS/floatsdsds.github.io/raw/master/_data/Lu%20Fan%20DM.pdf){: .btn .btn_info}

As I mentioned in the resume, I'm quite skilled in plotting in R. Here I set out some selected plots I've made in the past year. It is also an intuitive summary of my first year researching experience.

## MY FOUR YEAR CAMPUS

Actually, I first conceived this self-explantory page to explain on my poor overall GPA.
