## OVERVIEW

Hmm...Welcome! Thank you for being here :D.

I have prepared [a formal resume](https://github.com/floatSDSDS/floatsdsds.github.io/raw/master/_data/Lu%20Fan%20DM.pdf). In this post nothing would be repeated, the page is more colorful and personal. In addition, I also have a project page at the top right corner. [Donload Resume](https://github.com/floatSDSDS/floatsdsds.github.io/raw/master/_data/Lu%20Fan%20DM.pdf){: .btn .btn_info}

As I mentioned in the resume, I'm quite skilled in plotting in R. Here I set out some selected plots I've made in the past year. It is also an intuitive summary of my first year researching experience.

## MY FOUR YEAR CAMPUS

Actually, It is the feeling to explain on my poor overall GPA first made me conceived this self-explantory post.

My first (two) year(s) campus was busy but colorful. I've took part in 4 different student associations. Including student union, volunteer association, ping-pong association and arial radio controled model team. I was kind of overload and got a really bad academic performance.

I started to focus on the courses from the second year. It was the practical projects that stirred my interest to my major. I started to find interest in coding and calculating, the control theroy and computer vision (Note that everything relatives to motor still bothers me a lot).

It was the course Artificial Intelligence taught by Prof. Xuan led me to the world of data science. Since then I have embraced the true love.

Finally, I calculated and visualized my four year GPA (unofficially) to highlight the upward trend as follow.
